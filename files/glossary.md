## Front end Developer
A front end developer works on "front end" code in an application, commonly meaning the code that customers and product users interact with directly. A "front end dev" will typically write CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to build complex interfaces for people to use. The front end development stack is always changing but tends to involve a front end library like Angular, React, Vue or Web components and a lot of backend knowledge in "tooling" like yarn / npm.

## Gulp.js
Gulp.js is a toolkit available for JavaScript that helps to streamline the building process and allows the automation of menial tasks often found within repetitive front-end development. It works by using Node.js streams to pass data through connected plugins.

Typically much of the time dedicated to front-end development ends up being used for repeated processes like removing small statements or needing to adjust a word for each line of code. Solutions would involve having your own build process that will do the boring work for you, or utilizing a task runner. Thatâ€™s where gulp comes in, being a plugin that will act as that task runner, and allowing users to easily get past the busy work and move onto the bigger projects with their time.
